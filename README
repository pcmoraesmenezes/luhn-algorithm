# Credit Card Validator

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple C program that checks the validity of a credit card using the Luhn algorithm. The program prompts the user to input their credit card number, name, and card brand, and then determines whether the provided credit card information is valid or not.

## Features

- **Credit Card Validation**: Uses the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers.
- **User Interaction**: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting credit card details.
- **Brand Recognition**: Allows users to specify the brand of the credit card.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the credit card validator:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-validator.git
   cd credit-card-validator
   ```

2. **Compile and Run the Program**:

   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o credit_card_validator
   ./credit_card_validator
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**:

   - Enter the credit card number without spaces.
   - Provide your name.
   - Enter the brand of the credit card.

4. **View Validation Result**:

   The program will output whether the provided credit card information is valid or not.
